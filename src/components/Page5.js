            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In conclusion, my experience with Node.js and React was good. Both frameworks performed to my expectations and were easy to install. Something that I noticed was that there was a small learning curve with React especially. In comparison to regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP. I had some initial trouble figuring out how to create pages but I ended up working it out in the end. At the beginning of the project I had initially planned to create my website using Django as a backend framework because I had previous experience creating applications with the framework overall. However, I ran into issues with trying to create different pages. So much so that I decided to scrap the project and start over. I have no regrets with switching over to Node.js. In fact, I wish I switched sooner.</p>
